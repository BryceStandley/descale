1. Core Architecture
Backend:
Use ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8 or newer) with Entity Framework Core for data access.
Design it around Clean Architecture or DDD principles to keep your code modular, testable, and future-proof.

Database:
Use SQL Server or PostgreSQL, depending on your preference and feature needs.
Incorporate Migrations with EF Core for schema management.

Authentication:
Consider JWT tokens for stateless auth or ASP.NET Identity if you need more built-in user management.
If scanners need secure access, consider short-lived JWTs or QR-based session initiation.

2. Frontend Web Interface (Desktop)
Tech Stack:
Use Blazor Server or Blazor WebAssembly if you want to stay within .NET, or React/Vue if you prefer a JS-based SPA.
Blazor WebAssembly works well with shared models across backend and frontend.

Features:

Inventory management

Order picking/packing/shipping UI

Admin controls (locations, users, permissions)

Live dashboarding (SignalR or polling)

3. Mobile Interface
Option A: Native Android App
Tech Stack:
Use .NET MAUI to write cross-platform native apps with C# (ideal for Zebra devices running Android).
Alternatively, use Kotlin/Java if deep device integration is needed.

Key Features:

Barcode scanning (Zebra SDK)

Order picking UI

Realtime sync via API

Offline support (SQLite + background sync)

Option B: Cutdown Web UI
Use Blazor WASM, Razor Pages, or a lightweight React/Vue mobile-first PWA.

Apply a minimalist UI tailored for touch + scanning workflows.

Zebra devices' enterprise browser or Chrome can handle it well.

4. API Design
RESTful endpoints for:

Inventory

Orders

Shipments

Locations

User/device auth

Secure endpoints with role-based authorization.

Swagger for dev/testing.

5. Infrastructure
Host the backend via:

Azure App Service, AWS App Runner, or on-premises depending on latency/security needs.

Use Azure SQL/PostgreSQL, Blob Storage (for docs/images), and SignalR service if needed.

CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps.

6. Zebra/Scanner Support
If using web: support DataWedge or enterprise browser barcode input.

For native apps: integrate Zebraâ€™s EMDK or DataWedge intent APIs.

7. Optional Extras
Background job processing with Hangfire or Quartz.NET

Realtime inventory updates with SignalR

Auditing and logging with Serilog + Seq

Role-based dashboards (e.g., picker, loader, admin)
